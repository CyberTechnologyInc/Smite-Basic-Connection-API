# Smite Basic Connection API
Useful class that allows you to connect to the Smite API service, while also fetching some results. Barely any setup required to get started.

Look at index.php for an example of how to use my script to gather a list of any player's friends.

# Setup
The only setup required is editing config.php, first of all you'll need to sign up for the Smite API if you haven't already using their site: https://fs12.formsite.com/HiRez/form48/secure_index.html (This may get outdated, if it does simply use google)
After you do that you'll get an email saying whether or not you were accepted, if you were accepted then you will receive your DEV ID and your API KEY.
Replace your DEV ID and your API KEY in config.php.
And finally, to setup the database connection you'll need to change the details of the database name, username and password in the configuration file.
